# Let's Test!

## Story

Once upon a time there was an old wise Mentor, who had many students. He would teach them how to write code.
The old wise Mentor would prepare exercises, challenges and projects for them to do, and then later
he would take the students' code and check, whether it is done properly. As time went on, the Mentor got
wiser (and older) and the number of his students grew even more. Eventually, checking his students'
code would take hours from old wise Mentor's precious time, so he thought: "Why am I checking these
exercises manually? I'm a programmer, after all. I automatize things!".

And then, the old wise Mentor wrote a piece of code, that was designed to check other pieces of code automatically.
And thus, unit tests were born.

## What are you going to learn?

- how to configure unit tests framework
- how to run unit tests to check the correctness of your code's results
- get accustomed to using Python's `unittest` testing libarry


## Tasks

1. Configure the testing framework in your IDE of choice. You can find the instructions on how to do it in the Background section. Just read the sections about configuring the framework and running the tests - you don't have to learn how to write unit tests yet ;)
    - The testing framework is configured for this project.
    - The testing framework has discovered 3 unit tests.
    - You can start the tests and then, you get to see their results (which by default should be all negative).

2. Implement given functions and then run the unit tests to assure, that you've done so properly.
    - All 3 unit tests pass (they appear as green).
    - The functions' names and parameters (their names and order) haven't been changed.
    - The functions operate on logic and don't return hardcoded values, so that they just pass the tests.
